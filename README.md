## About Me
My name is Abraham Raji. I'm a maker. I design and build solutions to problems that fascinate me. I consider myself a minimalist who believes in sensible and intuitive design that is beautiful both on the outside as well as under the hood.

## Under the hood
- Hugo
    - My own Hugo theme : [Gruvhugo](https://gitlab.com/avron/gruvhugo)
- Basic Web Tech (HTML5, CSS and JS)
